# OFTR-004: Setup, Sync, and Profile Creation Commands

## Overview

Outfitter provides setup and maintenance commands that launch Pi-native onboarding, synchronize remote profile sources, and generate placeholder profile folders.

## Requirements

### OFTR-004.1: Setup Command

1. Outfitter MUST provide a `setup` command.
2. The `setup` command MUST launch Pi with Outfitter runtime onboarding and MUST NOT run terminal setup prompts.
3. The `setup` command MUST force Pi-native onboarding even when existing Outfitter settings are present.
4. The `setup <source>` command MUST preserve the provided source and hand it to Pi-native onboarding.
5. Setup writes MUST happen from the Pi-native `/outfitter` flow after Pi starts.

### OFTR-004.2: Sync Command

1. Outfitter MUST provide a `sync` command.
2. The `sync` command MUST read and validate settings before synchronizing sources.
3. The `sync` command MUST fetch or update remote settings sources and URI-based profile sources.
4. The `sync` command MUST store plain URI-based profile sources without `ref` or repository subpaths under `~/.outfitter/cache/profiles/<encoded-uri>/`, and MUST store URI or GitHub sources with `ref` or repository subpaths under `~/.outfitter/cache/repos/<encoded-uri-and-ref>/`.
5. The encoded URI cache path MUST support non-GitHub URIs.
6. The `sync` command MUST validate profiles loaded from synchronized sources.
7. The `sync` command SHOULD report whether each source was updated, unchanged, skipped, or failed.
8. The first version of `sync` MUST NOT require lockfile-based profile source reproducibility.
9. The `sync` command MUST redact credentials embedded in source URIs from user-facing output.

### OFTR-004.3: Create Profile Command

1. Outfitter MUST provide a `profile create` command.
2. The `profile create` command MUST require a destination scope or destination path.
3. The `profile create` command MUST require a profile name.
4. The `profile create` command MUST create a placeholder profile folder with a valid `profile.yml` file.
5. The `profile create` command SHOULD create conventional subfolders for common profile resources.

### OFTR-004.4: Command Object Implementation

1. All CLI command entry points MUST execute command objects rather than duplicate implementation logic in parser callbacks.
2. Command objects MUST accept typed input objects rather than reading directly from `process.argv`.
3. Command objects SHOULD receive filesystem, settings, profile, and process dependencies through constructors or equivalent dependency injection.
4. The `profile create` parser entry point MUST execute the profile-creation command object.

### OFTR-004.5: List Profiles Command

1. Outfitter MUST provide a `profile list` command.
2. The `profile list` command MUST read and validate settings before listing profiles.
3. The `profile list` command MUST list unique profile IDs from configured local and cached remote profile sources.
4. When multiple configured sources define the same profile ID, the listed profile metadata MUST come from the highest-precedence loaded definition.
